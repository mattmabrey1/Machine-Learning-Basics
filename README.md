# Machine-Learning-Basics
Artificial Intelligence project and extra credit where I tested common machine learning methods on beginner data sets such as the digits, iris, and human activity recognition datasets. I used train-test split, cross-fold validation, support vector machines, k-means clustering, and the Gaussian Mixture method throughout the project to determine the best hyperparameters and fit each model. Principal component analysis was also used to help graph the results. 


The human activity recognition dataset was too large to upload to Github so you can download it from here:

The Digits and Iris datasets are able to be imported from the Python sklrean package as:
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
